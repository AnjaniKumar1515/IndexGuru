        How do I get my returns in Mutual Funds?
        </h2>
      
     

        Like other asset classes, Mutual Funds returns are calculated by computing appreciation in the value of your investment over a period as compared to the initial investment made. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong style={{color: "#10b983"}}> Net Asset Value </strong> of Mutual Fund indicates its price and is used in calculating returns from your  <strong style={{color: "#10b983"}}>Mutual Fund investments.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        Return over a period is calculated as the difference in sale date<strong style={{color: "#10b983"}}>  NAV </strong> and purchase date NAV upon  purchase date NAV and converted to percentage by multiplying the result by 100 .
        <br />
        <br/>
        Any <strong style={{color: "#10b983"}}> net dividend*  </strong>or other income distribution by the fund during the holding period is also added to the capital appreciation while computing total returns.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong style={{color: "#10b983"}}> Capital appreciation </strong>in Mutual Funds is reflected by increase in NAV over time. This happens because NAV of a fund is derived from stock prices of companies included in the portfolio of the fund, and the prices fluctuate every day.
        <br />
        <br />
        Change in NAV of a fund over time contributes to the capital appreciation or <strong style={{color: "#10b983"}}> loss in your holding.</strong> View the return performance of your investments in the account statement provided to you by the fund house.
